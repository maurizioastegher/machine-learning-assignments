# Machine Learning Assignments

Machine Learning course assignments.

## Assignment 1

The goal of this assignment is to learn and test a Bayesian network for the Iris flower dataset using the Hugin Lite software.
The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, we can build a model to distinguish the species from each other.
To learn the Bayesian network we use a training set of examples randomly taken from the dataset (100 examples balanced with respect to the type attribute). We will then use the remaining examples to test the learned network. The sampler.py script generates three different training sets with three associated test sets.

## Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment is to compare the performance of three well-known classification algorithms using the scikit-learn library for the Python programming language.
First we create a dataset for a binary classification problem, then we train the three classification algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) and finally we evaluate their performance.

## Assignment 3

The goal of this assignment is to build a convolutional neural network for the MNIST database, i.e. a large collection of handwritten digits to be labeled, and evaluate performance when removing its layers. This goal can be achieved using the TensorFlow Python library.
